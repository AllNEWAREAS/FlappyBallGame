            How to Play
        </h1>

        <p id = "instructionDescription"; align = "left">
            Tap repeatly to control the ball flying (tap any key on keyboard if you are using computer; use your finger if you are playing on the phone)
            <br>
            Ball can eat coins, rages, and exilers during the gameplay
            <br>
            Coin count will affect the speed of the hazzards, higher the count, faster the speed
            <br>
            Size effect is the difference bewteen rage count and exiler count
            <br>
            Positive size effect will result the larger ball
            <br>
            Negative size effect will result the smaller ball
            <br>
            So, eat wisely!!! too small, game over! too large, game over!
            <br>
            Don't forget to avoid the hazzards, crash on them, game over!
